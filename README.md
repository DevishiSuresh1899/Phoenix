PREDICTION AND MANAGEMENT OF FLOODS

(This is a brief description of our idea of an app to assist people and reduce the damage due to floods)

PREDICTION

The app will use  data from India Meteorological Department(IMD) and send timely warnings to the users about the possible occurence of a flood. In the event a flood occurs,safe locations are immediately determined (i.e. based on the flood level warning issued by the IMD we plan on using google maps to determine which areas are above the flood level.Then we will use AR to assist the people to these safe areas).

OCCURENCE

The app will have a distress button which when pressed will send the pre-registered aadhar number and the current location of the user to the server using GPS with wireless mesh technology in case the user has no access to internet during calamity. This ensures the planned  evacuation of most of the people.

MANAGEMENT

One part of it will store information regarding present location of registered users which will help the user to know whereabouts of family members and friends.The aadhar number can be used to get more details about the person.The complete medical bio data of the user will also be in stored in the app's database so specific  medification can be given to him.It will also have live updates regarding how many people are currently in each shelter, how much resources are available and more.

FUTURE PLAN

In cases where the disaster might occur at night or a person is not able to respond to the warnings and notifications within a predetermined time frame, then a copy of his fingerprint/iris or aadhar number is automatically sent to the nearest safety shelter which can be processed using aadhar database to get more information and rescue him.
